EDA project
# Capstone Project: COVID-19 World Vaccination Progress

## About

On a Kaggle dataset examining COVID-19 global vaccination progress, I performed basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib packages. This comprised data cleansing, manipulation, and visualisation in order to answer some assumptions based on the data being investigated.

##  Install

This project required Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly

##  Data Dictionary 

The dictionary from this dataset (country_vaccinations.csv) was obtained from:
https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress

1. Country: this is the country for which the vaccination information is provided;
2. ISO_code: ISO code for the country.
3. Date: date for the data entry; for some of the dates we have only the daily vaccinations, for others, only the (cumulative) total.
4. Total_vaccinations: this is the absolute number of total immunizations in the country.
5. People_vaccinated: a person, depending on the immunization scheme, will receive one or more (typically 2) vaccines; at a certain moment, the number of vaccination might be larger than the number of people.
6. People_fully_vaccinated: this is the number of people that received the entire set of immunization according to the immunization scheme (typically 2); at a certain moment in time, there might be a certain number of people that received one vaccine and another number (smaller) of people that received all vaccines in the scheme.
7. Daily_vaccinations_raw: for a certain data entry, the number of vaccination for that date/country.
8. Daily_vaccinations: for a certain data entry, the number of vaccination for that date/country.
9. Total_vaccinations_per_hundred: ratio (in percent) between vaccination number and total population up to the date in the country.
10. People_vaccinated_per_hundred: ratio (in percent) between population immunized and total population up to the date in the country.
11. People_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred: ratio (in percent) between population fully immunized and total population up to the date in the country.
12. Daily_vaccinations_per_million: ratio (in ppm) between vaccination number and total population for the current date in the country.
13. Vaccines: total number of vaccines used in the country (up to date).
14. Source_name: source of the information (national authority, international organization, local organization etc.).
15. Source_website: website of the source of information
